### 💡 Projects

**🔍 Legendary Pokémon Classifier**  
Developed a machine learning model to predict whether a Pokémon is legendary based on stats and attributes from a dataset of 802 entries.  
- Used  `Decision Tree`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `XGBoost`, and exploratory data analysis to achieve **~90% F1**  
- Focused on data preprocessing and **classification evaluation metrics**  
- Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

### 🔍 Predicting National Well-Being (Life Ladder Score)  
Built a regression model using the World Happiness Report 2018 dataset to estimate a country’s *Life Ladder* score — a measure of subjective well-being — based on socioeconomic, health, and governance features.

**🛠️ Skills & Tools:**  
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Regression, Supervised Learning, Model Evaluation, Feature Importance, GridSearchCV

### 🕵️‍♂️ Phishing Website Detection  
Developed a binary classification model to detect phishing websites based on engineered URL features. The project applies supervised learning techniques to identify malicious (phishing) vs. legitimate websites, focusing on recall to minimize missed phishing attempts.  

**🛠️ Skills & Tools:**  
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Feature Engineering, SMOTE (class balancing), GridSearchCV, Model Evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC), matplotlib
